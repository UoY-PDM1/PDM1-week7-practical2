    <h1>Exercise 1.2</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The assets folder contains two images. Load both into your sketch. Use blue-sky.jpg as 
                the sketch background. Once it's loaded, use its width and height properties to set the size of the canvas. 
                Create a flying planes animation using plane.png (see the video below). Your sketch should meet the 
                following requirements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sky should fill the canvas.</li>
                <li>There should be at least two aeroplanes travelling across the sky from left to right 
                    at different altitudes (different y locations).
                </li>
                <li>One plane should appear further away (i.e. smaller) and should travel faster than the other.</li>
                <li>Once a plane passes out of view on the right side of the canvas, reset its x position so 
                    it can travel across the sky again.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

                    <p>To create two planes, you only need to load plane.png once. You can call <code>image()</code> with the same loaded image more than once 
                    and set the displayed size to be different each time.</p>
                    <p>The plane image is large so you will want to display it much smaller e.g. at a quarter or a third of its actual size.</p>
                    <p>You will need two global variables to track the x position of each plane and separate conditionals to figure out if an individual plane 
                        has left the right side of the canvas.
                    </p>
                    <p>You could consider writing a Plane class although this is not essential.</p>
